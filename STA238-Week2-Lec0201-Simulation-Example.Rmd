We want to simulate some data to help us investigate if hairloss is related to eating broccoli.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

set.seed(20210121)

eat_broccoli <- sample( x=c("Never", "Always", "Sometimes"), 
                        size=10,
                        replace=TRUE,
                        prob = c(0.8, 0.15, 0.05) )
hairloss <- runif(n=10, min=0, max=1)
age <- rpois(n=10, lambda=35)

my_hairloss_data <- tibble(age, eat_broccoli, hairloss)

```
